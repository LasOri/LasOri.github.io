Greetings! I'm Laci – a dedicated husband, proud owner of two furry companions named Floppy and Dongó (which means bumblebee), and a seasoned software developer with nearly 15 years of experience in the industry.

Throughout my career, I've worked extensively on mobile projects, including mobile SDKs and backend development. I also have experience with cross-platform solutions. I firmly believe in the advantages of agile and extreme programming methodologies.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests and hobbies. I'm an avid traveler, always eager to explore new destinations and cultures. I'm also a book enthusiast, and enjoy spending my leisure time immersed in games and tabletop RPGs. Staying active is also important to me, and I try my best to work out a few times a week.

This platform serves as a space for me to share insights on software development, alongside discussions on various interests and hobbies. It's important to note that my aim here is not to prescribe universal truths or methodologies; rather, each expression reflects my personal viewpoint.
